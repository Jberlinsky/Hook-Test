      Google Earth Engine brings together the world's satellite imagery
      &mdash; trillions of scientific measurements dating back almost 40 years
      &mdash; and makes it available online with tools for scientists,
      independent researchers, and nations to mine this massive
      warehouse of data to detect changes, map trends and quantify
      differences on the Earth's surface.  Applications include:
      detecting deforestation, classifying land cover, estimating forest
      biomass and carbon, and mapping the world’s roadless areas.

      In a collaboration led by Dr. Matthew Hansen at the University of
      Maryland, we’ve produced the
      <a href="http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest">
        first 30 meter resolution maps of global forest change</a>,
      from 2000-2012.  This work, which was published in
      <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/850">Science</a> on
      November 15th, used Earth Engine to analyze over 650,000 Landsat 7 scenes,
      required one million CPU hours, but thanks to parallel processing, took
      only a few days.  For more information, please visit the

    "fulldescription": "Generated by analyzing the extensive database of roads in Google Maps, this proof-of-concept global map displays in a green-gradient all areas of land that are more than ten (10) kilometers from the nearest road, rail or navigable waterway.  The gradient darkens with distance, and significant large roadless areas in the world are readily apparent, such as the Amazon rain forest, Sahara desert, Canadian boreal forest and Indonesian islands such as Borneo.  This Earth Engine project was initiated at the request of Member of European Parliament Kriton Arsenis in collaboration with the Society for Conservation Biology, to support their Roadless Areas initiative being proposed at the Rio+20 Conference.  Caveat: the road data used to produce these maps inevitably contains inaccuracies and omissions, and the criteria for defining \"roadless areas\" is expected to evolve as policy discussions continue.  We expect to regenerate this map as road data and policy formulations evolve.",

    "fulldescription": "Based on the Vegetation Continuous Field layers developed as part of the MODIS standard land product suite, we have implemented a Landsat-based VCF of percent tree crown cover for Mexico.  This prototype product was created principally from 4 years of input data to overcome data gaps found in any individual year.  Landsat ETM+ from 2000 to 2004 were the primary inputs.  Data from the Mexico National Forest Inventory were made available for algorithm calibration and validation.   Combined with the Google Earth Engine computing capability, this map was produced in less than one week and represents an advance in large-scale processing of moderate spatial resolution data for forest cover monitoring.  The same method has been applied for the United States as part of the WELD project.   For the MODIS implementation, please refer to Hansen et al. Earth Interactions, 2003.  For the Landsat implementation, please refer to Hansen et al., Remote Sensing Letters, 2010.",

Forest was defined as 30% or greater canopy cover for trees of 5 meters or more in height. All such assemblages that were converted to non-forest are quantified and labeled as forest cover loss. Forest cover loss was divided into three categories, primary forest cover loss (red), secondary forest cover loss (yellow) and woodland loss (orange). Over 8,000 Landsat images were processed to make this product.  A final version of this map will be the initial derived product of the Observatoire Satellital des Forêt d’Afrique Centrale’s FACET (Forêt d’Afrique Centrale Evaluée par Télédétection) product suite.",
